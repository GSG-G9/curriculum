# Cohort Code of Conduct

This activity will result in a shared code of conduct that you have collectively agreed to. These are rules that you will be expected to live up to, and that you can expect everyone else in your cohort to live up to as well.

The rules you come up with will supplement, and must not contradict, the existing FAC-wide [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)

## Think

In teams of 4, discuss between you the rules that you think you should live by during your time in the FAC classroom. Come up with a list of 8-10 rules that you agree on as a group.

Consider:
  - What will help you learn most?
  - What might prevent you from learning?
  - What group mindset or beliefs might strengthen your learning?
  - What will make you feel comfortable, included, and able to give your best?
  - What would your ideal learning environment feel like?

## Discuss

As a whole cohort, go around each table and discuss the rules that the group came up with. You can ask for clarification or ask further questions about other teams' rules. If you disagree with a rule that another team has come up with, it should be discussed openly in the cohort and either re-worded in a way that everyone can agree with, or removed.

## Combine

Combine the remaining rules that have been agreed by the whole cohort to come up with a definitive list. Where two rules are very similar they can be combined or the cohort can select the most appropriate one.

## Publish

Your course facilitator will add the list to your cohort folder in the relevant organisation. You can refer back to these rules at any time.

## Use

You should strive to follow these rules during your time in the classroom at FAC. They have been decided by your cohort, as a collective, as guidelines. You can refer back to these, and you can expect others to live up to them. In case you feel that someone is not living up to their agreement, there are many opportunities to raise this, such as in your team or cohort retrospectives or by speaking with your course facilitator.
