# Research Afternoon

## Command Line
1. Research how to:
  + customise your command line to make it pretty and useful (ie. git branch/branch status parser)
  + install using a package manager
2. Create a "workshop", designed to walk the rest of your cohort through the steps (this doesn't need to be long - just one markdown file)

## Regular Expressions
1. Research:
  + How to use regex
    + (basic) pattern creation and repetitions
    + (advanced) groups
  + Find and use on-line tools such as [regex101](https://regex101.com/)
2. Create a code snippet using regex such as (for example) email validator:
+ us3r1@foundersandcoders.com
  + user must start with an alphabetical character;
  + user can contain also other characters (which ones?);
  + site and user are always separated by a snail/small duck/AT symbol (@);
  + site is always done with at least 3 alphabetical characters, a dot and at least 2 more alphabetical characters

## Accessibility
1. Research how to:
  + write an accessible navbar
  + write an accessible modal  
  (Hint: think about semantic HTML, managing focus, adding key handlers, adding aria attributes)
2. Refactor one of your team's websites (or one from the rest of your cohort if necessary) to reflect what you've learned

## CSS
1. Research:
  + responsive vs mobile-first design
  + how to write CSS with BEM
2. Refactor one of your team's websites to reflect what you've learned
