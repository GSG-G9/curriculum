### Stop
+ Make welcome speech finish @ 12.30 then schedule in photos
+ Lack of communication between week's mentors, and between mentors and the rest of FAC _before_ week starts
+ Too much mentor talking during s-g-c, rather than student participation
+ Asking them to sit in a circle before writing the s-g-c board - it makes them nervous to participate
+ Accessibility workshop so focused on blind users, or even disabled people in general - more about browser support & performance in areas of poor internet
+ Research topics separate from project - encourages them to think of it as "just an exercise"
+ Jigsawing - does it work, when we emphasise everyone being across the codebase?

### Go
+ Plan meeting with all mentors before week starts - so no one is questioning each other during workshops / morning challenges
+ Enough time to review each other's material to make the whole week coherent
+ Alumni introduce themselves before code reviews
+ Clearer autonomy / lack of autonomy over decisions about that week and overall structure of the course
+ Plan bis dev roles and hand over before week 1
+ Plan days off e.g. bank holidays before week 1
+ Stronger git workshop
+ Consistency between weeks - make sure precedents we have set get carried through
+ Slides / something visual for intro talk
+ Better way of walking through github organisations, especially in pointing out the business repo(s) so that they know what to expect from business meetings
+ Task group handover smoother
+ Whole cohort/organisation needs to agree to any precedents that get set in week 1, otherwise it's wasted effort

### Continue
+ Accessibility as a key part of the week
+ Clarification of git flow after projects, during week 1 - or do this at the end of the git workshop
+ Responding to the students needs on the fly
+ Time to plan presentations
+ Use extra time wisely e.g. assigning bis dev roles when we found we had spare time
+ Spend time with them at lunch. Get to know students
+ Raising issues on master reference / london curriculum
+ Notice potential community problems & nipping in the bud early
+ Communicate to next week mentors and others in the space
+ Talks from alumni from past cohorts (over external speakers in week 1-8?) - _really_ appreciated by FAC10 & helps with sense of community
+ Welcome talk from directors! WebRTC to share this with other campuses? :wink:

### Precedent
+ Prime directive
+ Baking in accessibility. Checks at every project, not just week 1
+ Alumni involvement - code reviewing, critiquing presentations
+ Encouraging the idea that they are being enveloped into a community. We are teaching them collaborative learning
+ Circle for s-g-cs and projects. Laptops down
+ Alumni sitting in the circle, not on sofas - doing this _with_ them, not _to_ them
+ Cleanliness is a norm, not an apology/joke
+ Git flow in week 1
+ User stories in week 1
+ Timing discipline / communication e.g. using the whiteboard
+ Prepare questions to cover in Q&A
+ Alumni introduce themselves when they watch presentations
+ CONTRIBUTING.md repos
+ Structure repos prior to FAC starting
+ Structure and timings for presentations provided
+ Encourage raising issues and contributing to FAC from the start
+ Present research topics as spikes of learning that are useful for people's projects
+ Encouraging self-organising - write the timetable on the board and/or post a link in gitter and walk away
+ Stricter on timings
