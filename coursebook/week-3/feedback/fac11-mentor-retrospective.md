#### Handover from London
+ [Learning outcomes](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-3/learning-outcomes.md)
  + When introducing, just be aware that these now include software architecture & flexbox
+ [Intro workshop](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/api-workshop)
  + After introducing learning outcomes, play the ["What is an API video"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY) (in `resources.md`)  
  Note: If you chromecast, the video lags. Try a cable (if you have one) or ask students to bring headphones
+ Remember to refer students to [`resources.md` file](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-3/resources.md)
  + **Clarification:** Were students using this file in the previous 2 weeks?
  + Yes, because mentors were making a concerted effort to point students to it - coming from [this issue](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/issues/364) raised by @oliverjam, because a lot FAC10 weren't really aware that a resources file existed
+ [Software architecture workshop](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/Workshop-Software-Architecture-Design)
  + There's a [mentor notes branch with a file that should help](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/Workshop-Software-Architecture-Design/blob/mentor-notes/mentor-notes/mentor-notes.md)
+ [Day 1 afternoon workshop](https://github.com/emilyb7/workshop-APIs)
  + DOM manipulation aspect fairly basic but students might need more help.
    + Lots of people here were stuck on it. We don't want students to struggle on that, when they should be focusing on the API element.
    + **AP:** Maybe before the workshop, send out a link for a refresher? Point them to the precourse material?
  + Timeboxing for tasks
    + Task 1 timeboxed for 45mins-1hr. Most people stayed on task 1 for whole 2 hours.
    + FAC10 & FACN1 experienced the same.
    + **AP:** Maybe change wording - make task 1 the whole workshop & change next bit to "bonus level"?
  + QUnit in this workshop
    + After hour people still trying to get their head around QUnit
    + **AP:** Get rid of testing from this workshop?
+ [FLexbox](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/week-3#day-2)
  + Week schedule only links to flexbox froggy. Game better supported if people look at CSS tricks beforehand.
    + Were they pairing on flexbox froggy? - Yes, mentors should always be giving verbal instructions for people to pair.
    + **AP:** Week schedule should link to CSS tricks article as well as flexbox froggy in first task
  + Timeboxing of flexbox froggy (1 hour in `master-reference`)& dice workshop (30 mins on week schedule) - written differently on the whiteboard in the morning - 45 mins on flexbox froggy and CSS tricks article, then 1 hour on dice workshop. This was a better estimation for how long it took.
    + **AP:** Adjust week schedule in `master-reference`  
    10:00 - 10:45 - Complete flexbox froggy, using CSS tricks article for support  
    10:45 - 11:45 - Flexbox dice workshop
  + Students asked for explanation of more advanced material that was mentioned at the end of the CSS tricks article e.g. flex shrink & flex grow
    + **AP:** Martha making explanation on these concepts. Could point FACN2 to this if they ask for the same
  + Be aware - dice workshop has solutions branch
+ [Elias' software design workshop](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/ws-software-design-js)
  + 4 markdown files, 3 exercises. Only the first two in stage 1 are feasible at the moment. Kind of ignored stage 2.
  + Abstraction exercise more complicated. Gave them a lot of hints about what they needed to do. Line 22 and 36 need to be abstracted into their own separate function. Need to use array reduce. Without those hints, they would have struggled. Had to go round and point them in the right direction a lot. Most hadn't done array reduce before.
  + Mavis: did they need hints with the closure stuff?
  + Jack: more straight forward. Still had to go round and help a lot. Lots of new concepts.
  + Martha: no prompt in repo to clone it
  + Jack: there are tests. lots of people didn't get how to run them because they hadn't cloned
+ [Introducing projects](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-3/project.md)
  + Be aware - we added in time for doing some architecture design together
  + Project brief doesn't include user stories.
    + **AP:** Prompt students to create these themselves, like they've seen in week 1 & 2
+ [Parallel function morning challenge](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-3/morning-challenge.md)
  + FAC11 were given 1 hour to work on this. Sohil and Jack spent 11-11:30 walking through the steps so FAC11 understood how parallel functions work and what they are used for.
  + **AP:** Contextualise it i.e. when you would use a parallel function e.g. in the context of API week project

#### Further questions from Nazareth
+ Mavis: software design workshop took 3 hours to do first stage?
  + Jack: Good to let them struggle with it. People wanted as much time as possible. People were exhausted afterwards but it was a satisfying process. You could do it faster but giving extra time to struggle on it was good.
  + Lubes: Did you give it to people and let them go through it? Or did you have to explain things yourself? Are there mentor notes?
  + Jack: Largely left them to it. There are some big markdown files that they read. So long as you're there to help with questions. The feedback was that they really enjoyed it.

+ Mavis: introduced projects yesterday - did you facilitate planning or left them to it?
  + Lucy: all seemed immersed and didn't need any prompts so left them to it.
