#### Postman
Postman is an HTTP client for testing web services (eg APIs). It allows you send a ton of requests to APIs without having to write out the code each time. It's a handy tool to know about.  

**Install postman:** you should have the Postman chrome plugin installed. If not, talk to a course mentor or
follow [this link](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/introduction)

**Open postman:** type 'chrome://apps/' into your chrome address bar

**Use postman:** read about postman in the documentation [here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/requests).
