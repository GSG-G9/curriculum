## APIs we can recommend

For your end-of-the week projects you'll need to query a couple of different APIs.

Third-party APIs can sometimes sound great but end up causing more trouble than they're worth. To help you make the best of your projects, here are some APIs that we (FAC9 London) have tried and tested:

### APIs

| Name        | Info           | API key required? | Rate limit? |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ----------------:| -----------:|
| [Giphy](https://api.giphy.com/)      | Lots and lots of GIFs | Giphy provides a free, public API key for small applications | Yes, but it's not clear how much (it's enough for your projects) |
| [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/) | Everything publically available on GitHub neatly presented and well documented! | No, but authentication required for higher rate limit | Yes, quite low |
| [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) | Lots of info about all kinds of movies, a bit like IMDB      | Yes, it's free |  40 requests every 10 seconds |
| [TFL](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/docs) | Everything you need to know about transport in London (powers City Mapper etc.) The documentation is quite heavy, but the API allows you to do cool things | Optional, allows for higher rate limit | Yes |
