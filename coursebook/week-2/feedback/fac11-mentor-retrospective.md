Wasn't taking notes yet:

Is the traffic lights morning challenge too hard?
+ Mavis - No prior intro to callbacks, does this make the challenge too difficult? I tried this and struggled with it.
+ Finn - we did a half hour explanation when students had questions. ([in this issue](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/issues/433))
+ Maybe Nazareth mentors can think about where this would fit best? As an explanation before the morning challenge, or clarification afterwards?

With the changes to this week, students aren't writing their own tests?
+ [suggested changes to day 1 schedule](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/issues/434)
+ Mavis - simplified fizz buzz after code-along?

Note taking started:

How did you feel, explaining callbacks as a concept? (Mavis)
+ Finn - it was hard. I've had a few conversations with people who have had particular struggles with it.
+ Oli - takes multiple attempts. I tried a few different examples, just to make sure that different people can get it in different ways. No one really grasps it in one go right at the beginning.
+ Jen - historically FAC has always struggled to explain this well. But FAC11 seem to be in a good position. Let's just make sure we take note of what Oli & Finn have told FAC11 in person and whatever Mavis and Reem do for FACN2?

Was having QUnit in one of the pure functions workshops problematic? (Mavis)
+ Finn - they only need to use the QUnit test file, not write any tests themselves. So it seems fine.
+ Oli - Good to show people that there are more testing frameworks out there.  
[Maybe remove the JQuery CDN though.](https://github.com/Jwhiles/pure-functions-easy-testing/issues/5)

How did the changes to the to-do app project go? (Mavis)
+ Other than tape, only did a bit of tweaking - added user stories, split the code into 2 files - frontend file & logic file
+ Mavis - main issue we had was that we weren't really walked through the skeleton code. A lot of our cohort spent the first day trying to understand what the code was doing.
+ Finn - FAC11 are having that exact problem
+ Oli - important for people to learn how to jump into an existing codebase. Tried to make them aware of what the pre-written funcitons were doing.
+ Mavis - readme looks a lot better now
+ Oli - lots of problems with mutating objects / object reference, have to be able to clone an array properly. Zooey gave a talk this morning on 2 objects that are / aren't the same. That's catching a lot of people out. Zooey shared a [repl.it example](https://repl.it/JQBB/9)
+ Mavis - mutating objects was a real issue for us too
+ Oli - they did have an example in the DOM manipulation challenge. So they have done it, but it's just about helping them to realise what happened then.
+ Oli - the one in the readme is the older version. John needs to merge his forked version into MG's one. I'll try to make sure that happens. I'll double check that John is going to do this.

Did students ask any challenging questions throughout the week (Reem)
+ Oli - do you guys actually practise TDD?
+ Oli - quite difficult to explain callbacks
+ Finn - the hardest concept for them - difference between a function as a variable and a function that has been called (i.e. functions as a first class object)
+ Oli - tried to show this in the callback explanation
+ Finn - I gave one student a more comprehensive set of examples and asked them to guess what they expected each result to be before we ran it.
+ Oli - In general, make sure you don't act like people are bound to find things difficult.  
e.g. We didn't say that the bonus levels in `learn-tape` were likely to be hard. We didn't introduce the traffic light morning challenge as really difficult.  
Don't prime people to think it's going to be too hard for them, otherwise they'll assume that's the case.
