### Stop
+ DWYL TDD tutorial introducing npm too soon
+ Don't introduce business roles one at a time - students have to wait a long time doing nothing
+ QUnit fizz buzz too easy?

### Go
+ Run a callbacks workshop before waterfall workshop
+ Have longer for waterfall workshop so you can introduce async more in-depth
+ Roman numerals walkthrough

### Continue
+ Putting the day's schedule on the board
+ Mentors presence downstairs! Remind FAC10 that you are ready and waiting to help them, so they don't feel awkward asking
+ Group cohesion - Nelson's getting to know you game

### Precedent
+ Putting mentors' names on the board every day
