### Stop
- Having only 3 mentors assigned per week. Marina thinks 4 people would be better (maybe 3 main + 1 extra **only if** the main 3 have any problems) to add some redundancy and not overburden the course coordinator. 

### Go
- Reshuffle introductory Hapi workshops / tutorials. As we know, one of the problems with the makemehapi tutorial is that it assumes knowledge of certain concepts before we introduce them to it. At least half of the cohort struggled with the Hapi Vision exercise and Marko spent a lot of time explaining what views and templates are to each pair separately. So, we need to think carefully when we give them the tutorial. It might really be best to do it as a refresher after all the code alongs
- Write our own tests for makemehapi exercises, so we're not dependent on the npm module
- Reduce scope of server.inject workshop to writing, using and explaining the inject function in vanilla Node (Marina thinks nobody got to the stretch goals and also, people struggled to recreate the inject module as this required a really good grasp of how ‘fake’ requests are made when testing a server). 
- Confirm timings and mentor availability one week before the start of the week so that appropriate arrangements can be made in advance in case assigned mentors have any issues (e.g. taking leave from work, preparing material, other unexpected commitments etc). I know this is easier said than done, but it would be good to point this out during planning phase and also remind mentors along the way. 
- We had a 15min talk on Tuesday by Matt regarding the F&C bootcamps in Israel (just planned on the fly). This got us slightly off schedule on Tuesday. Try to follow planned timings as much as possible. 

### Continue
- Providing intro / context for the week. This takes quite some time and Marko thinks it was appreciated.
- Code-alongs! We think both Marko’s and Marina's went well and students enjoyed it. As Marina has pointed out, it takes a lot of preparation if you don't want to be debugging on the spot
- Providing an md file for the makemehapi tutorial (clearer, more readable than instructions in the Terminal)
- Float around and proactively ask people how they are getting on. Give hints (and not the solution) depending on their progress to help them
