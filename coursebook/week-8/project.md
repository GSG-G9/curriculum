## Project
### Task

- You are free to create **any kind of site that you like** (with authentication!)

- You may **continue your project from last week** if you agree as a team to do so.

- Create your site from a **user-centred design perspective**, by starting your planning phase with user stories.
  - i.e. "As a user I want to ______, so that ______"

The aim of the project is to fulfill the requirements below!

### Requirements
+ Use express and handlebars
+ Registration form with at least 2 fields - (e.g. username and password)
+ Client-side _and_ server-side validation on register form, including error handling that provides feedback to users
+ Login form
+ Users only have to log in once (i.e. implement a cookie-based session on login)
+ There should be protected routes and unprotected routes.
+ Any user-submitted content should be labelled with the authors username
+ Website content should be stored in a database -PostgreSQL-
+ Username is visible on all (or some) pages of the site after logging in
+ Test your routes

### Hints
+ Plan everything on paper or a whiteboard! for example...
  - db tables
  - server routes

### Examples
You could use auth to make a game, a todo app, a twitter clone or whatever. :smile:
