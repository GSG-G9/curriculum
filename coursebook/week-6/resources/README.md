## Resources

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql#concept-intro) provides an interactive introductory course to SQL. This is good for practising commands and getting used to the syntax.

[Stanford Online](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about) offer a fairly comprehensive MOOC about databases. If you've already covered some introductory material and want a firmer grounding then the course will cover everything you need (it's definitely **not** required for F&C!). The whole course contains a lot of ground, but the most relevant sections for us are:

* [Introduction and Relational Databases](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/RDB/SelfPaced/about)

* [SQL](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/SQL/SelfPaced/about)
