# WEEK 5 - Node vol. 2 - Mentor Notes 

## Presentation

There is a presentation created by FAC12 mentors and updated by FAC13 mentors for this week. You can find it here: 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TN7Y3vnddgSYzLAVwHLomg_eo6ngRYCioHTF0_58Y0M/edit#slide=id.p

You can use this presentation to intro the week, plus later to intro a few of the workshops. (it's not intended to be used all in one go)

## Research topics

There is one research topic on making an API request from the server. It might be a good idea to divvy up the 4 people who were in this research group across the 4 tables for the Request Module Morning Challenge the next day, as they will be more familar with the request module and can help others. 

## Node Shell workshop

Explain at the start of the Node Shell workshop that students need to write the code for each exercise inside a .js file, not directly in the terminal. This workshop is about writing programmes that run in the terminal.
