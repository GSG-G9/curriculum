## Morning challenge - day 3

Clone the [Morning challenge: Modularise a simple Node.js server](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/modules-challenge) repository to your computer and follow the instructions.

If you get stuck, look at [Dan's super simple starter kit for Node.js](https://github.com/sofer/sssk) to see an example of a simple modularised server. **Spoiler alert**: Dan's repo has all of the answers, so don't look at it unless you're really struggling.
