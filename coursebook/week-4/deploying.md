### Deploying

- *Cloud platforms*: What is PaaS? Why is it useful to be able to deploy your code to a cloud platform, rather than running it locally? What services are there that can provide you with a platform for your code? [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) is a good start, but try to find some others. Try to deploy a simple server to Heroku as a demo.

- *Environment variables*: Why might some variables in your code need to change for different environments? Why is it a bad idea to include those variables in a public repository? What modules might you use to help manage environment variables? (Look at [env2](https://github.com/dwyl/env2) from our neighbours at DWYL.) If you can, write some sample code to show how it works.
