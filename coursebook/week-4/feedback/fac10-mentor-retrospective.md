### Stop
+ The amount of process we have for updating the coursebook is overkill – if the title of a PR describes exactly what it does, then the absence of a further description definitely shouldn't be a blocking issue. And there were a few times that PRs were approved and not merged, which was a bit baffling. Remember points one and four (and arguably two) of the agile manifesto
+ Confusion with git flow for updating course book and creating course content (workshop, challenges etc). Larger PRs should be accepted during planning phase where assignees/reviewers are within the same mentor group for the week. I find this more efficient as a starting point for the mentors but I understand that this may be more work for the main F&C reviewers. 

### Go
+ Good to have a rota up front with two people assigned to each day – otherwise it's easy for stuff to slip between the gaps and end up realising at the last minute that you don't have any tutors arranged (easier said than done). Mentors rota could be in the form of the a table sitting in a separate readme file in the course book
+ It'd be great to tweak the schedule slightly for research afternoon - right now it's just shown as one big block of time from 14.00-18.00. Making it explicit when presentations start would be handy - probably 4.30-5.30 as the timings slip pretty easily.
+ Understanding that objects are passed by reference and primitives are passed by value in JavaScript should be mandatory knowledge for being accepted on to the course. If only because it's a tricky one to explain when you're put on the spot :wink:
+ Have more redundancy in terms of mentors per week (e.g. four instead of three) so that there are sufficient people engaged in case someone drops out because of other commitments. 
+ Maybe good to introduce a smaller ES6 morning challenge in week 3 so that people start getting used to the new syntax gradually. 

### Continue
+ Responding to students' needs - we had to change the plan slightly after we got ahead of schedule on Day One and ended up doing the modularisation challenge two days early, which resulted in having to create some new materials and shuffle things around. But if anything, that's a positive – if the group's learning faster than we planned and we're able to push ahead and create new resources to fill the gap
+ Having two mentors per day present in class (one "driver" and one "navigator"). If mentors try to encourage students to work in teams, be collaborative and pair-program more, I think mentors should also lead by example. F&C is all about building a community and having mentors who collaborate well is a great piece in the whole picture. 
+ Be proactive and ask students about their progress. Be there to help them all day and don’t assume they know all the new terminology you introduce them to, as part of the week’s theme. 
+ Code alongs - they are very beneficial for  the learning experience of the students and great fun for the mentors (they require very good preparation though to make sure live coding goes well!)


**Action points**
+ Better communication about things that will have an effect on every week (e.g. ideal week structure, where everything lives in the master reference, making the contributing process as simple and transparentas possible). This should be done by cohort members during the curriculum planning phase, and the Course Coordinator should provide mentors with updates if anything has changed before their week starts.
