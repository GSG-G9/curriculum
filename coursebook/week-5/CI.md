## Continuous Integration

- Research what Continuous Integration is and what assurances it can provide when building an application.
- Create a basic Node project on Github that includes some tests with `Jest`, then sync your project with an online CI tool. Add a new feature to your project, commit your changes, then check on your CI tool to ensure your tests are still passing and your project build is passing. A popular tool is [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/), [this](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-travis) excellent tutorial will come in handy.
- (Bonus) after verifying the latest changes, display the [build](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3de407029531b1bcff394070e6d820d3f883a8c5/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f6e6a736669656c642f6d79736974652e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572) .svg file provided and display it at the top of your projects' README.md file.
